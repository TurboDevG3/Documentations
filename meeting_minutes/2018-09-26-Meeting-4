  a. Item orders: Individual orders must be compiled into groups. Group orders will be viewed by multiple different stores for each SKU, where suppliers will see each order and compete to offer best price.

2. Team discussion: Plan of where to start with the website building. Identifying necessary technology, timeline and skills needed.

To Do:

4. End of october - usable UI layout
