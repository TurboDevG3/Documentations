MEETING #8

Date and Time: October 22, 5:00pm
Location: Armstrong 
Present: Yahya Azami, Nabil Ersyad Noor Eddie Putera, Thusha Sivapatharajah & Aliah Mohd Nazarudin

Discussion:
1. Presented the UI interface
2. Bootstrap is the technology used for the front end
3. Front end to back end
4. Back end won't directly call the database
5. If needed push more for microservices and chop parts separately, rather than combining them together
6. Professor's feedback: 
   a. Arrange items to the middle, so that left side is dedicated to some extra menu
   b. Must come up with a presentable version
   c. Try to resize the window and see if it's changing
   d. Must also try with tablet and desktop version
   e. Setting up test cases - soon

To Do:
1. Instead of adding more functionality, work on site appearance since whatever we see, must be closer to what we wanna show
2. Website must converge 
3. Test if it runs for one cycle - registering to receiving accepted bids
4. Mock whatever calls are going to the backend, so the way to call the back end to front end where the backend must be pre-programmed
5. Try getting extra professional help for web page design, so we can reach out to our target users, so search for best practices as well
6. Use existing bootstrap template 
7. Features to improve:
   a. Login page in a popup style 
   b. Homepage to have a slideshow for modern looks
   c. Single page style of front end - not so appropriate 
   d. Separate navigation, within collection of activities 
   e. Tutorial (add trainings) perhaps in help page or to start automatically when they visit a page for the first time. That way we don't overload the users
   f. Within pages, include workflow that of the order to indicate the steps and how far they progressed
   g. Want to see the complete cycle, where to start and what to do next
