MEETING #8

Date and Time: October 22, 5:30pm
Location: Armstrong 
Present: Yahya Azami, Nabil Ersyad Noor Eddie Putera, Thusha Sivapatharajah & Aliah Mohd Nazarudin

Discussion:
Present the UI Interface

Front end:
Technology used : Bookstrap

Front End - Back End

Back End - don't directly call the database
Since we wish to
Push more for microservices, chop separately, rather than combine them together

Comment by the Prof:
Arrange them to the middle
Left side should be dedicated to some extra menu

Must come up with version that we want to show
Try to resize the window and see if it's changing
Setting up test cases - soon
Must also try with tablet and desktop version


Next time:
Instead of adding more functionality, add up to more appearance
Whatever we see, must be closer to what we wanna show
Must converge 

What we wanna test:
This will get 1 cycle, from register, to receive bid accepted

MOCK whatever calls are going to the backend
Way to call the backend to front end

Backend must be pre-programmed

What kind of extra help we can give for target user: professional help
Search for best practices

Existing boostrap template 

Features:
Login page: popup style
Homepage: Slideshow (for modern sites)
Single page style of front end? - not so appropriate
Separate navigation, within collection of activies 
Tutorial (add trainings) 
within pages, workflow that we can do in order
Indicate the steps how far they progress
Modern way: tutorial start automatically when it starts
When visit page for the first time, then we dont overload the user


Want to see the complete cycle, where to start and what to do next
