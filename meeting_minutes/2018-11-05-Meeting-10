For catelogue: for ever category, put photos associated with it
Should not have large photos. Shouldn't be the slideshow because slideshow means the landing/welcome page
At certain point, just wanna see smaller photos, for the rest of catalogues: for practical point of view

Arrow changes, the shape of the arrow when it's up and down.

The part of the application that is most frequently used? Catalogue/Active Bids

Catalogue:  On top of based on category, also list by producers. It will be easier to sort them by the producers then category.
            Suppliers -> Category 

            Search Box 

Active Bids: First list or the default table that's provided must already have semantics
             How many bids expected?
             Depends on the suppliers
             The bids time: Max -- 48 hours
             Can you change the bid after you you place the bid? - That's interesting but it'll be hard.
             (Suggestion: within 48 hours it should be fine?)
             The algorithm - select the lowest price
             
             For example, they get the lowest bid, but they deliver the goods 3days later than the date they should send the goods,
             they should be penalized
             
             There should be a performance rate at the back ends.
             
             Tracking order? Confirm order, on the delivery, delivered.
